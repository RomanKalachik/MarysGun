LICENCE AGREEMENT 

1.Ownership of materials and copies
The Materials and related documentation are copyrighted works
of authorship, and are also protected under applicable database
laws. The Licensor retains ownership of the Materials and all
subsequent copies of the Materials, regardless of the form in
which the copies may exist. This licence is not a sale of the
original Materials or any copies.

2.Licence

2.1 Subject to clauses 2.1.2, 2.1.3 and 2.2, during the trial
period, the Licensor grants to you a limited, non-exclusive
licence to:

2.1.1 use one copy of the Materials for use on one desktop
computer or one laptop computer in object code format only
owned, leased and/or controlled by you or any member of your
corporate group, which expression includes the Corporate
Licensee, the Corporate Licensee's majority-owned subsidiaries,
any parent company having a majority-owned interest in the
Corporate Licensee, and such parent's majority-owned
subsidiaries;

2.1.2 install a second copy of the Materials on a portable
computer for your own exclusive use in object code format
provided the Materials on the portable computer are not being
used at the same time the Materials on the primary computer are
being used.

2.1.3 this licence is not and does not extend to the use of the
Materials on or in conjunction with a server and/or a network
of computers.

2.2 During the trial period:

2.2.1 the terms of this Agreement shall apply in full, with the
exception of clause 4;

2.2.2 you are entitled to cancel this Agreement and are under
no obligation to purchase the Materials;  

2.2.3 the use of the Materials will be limited by:
 (a) a specified time period; or
 (b) limited functionality; or
 (c) a combination of (a) and (b).

2.3 Upon payment of the applicable licence fee;

2.3.1 the Licensor grants to you a limited, non-exclusive
licence to carry on the activities referred to in clause 2.1;
and 

2.3.2 clause 2.2 shall no longer apply.

3. Licence restrictions

You may not use, copy, modify or transfer the Materials
(including any related documentation) or any copy, in whole or
in part, including any print-out of all or part of any database,
except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. If you
transfer possession of any copy of the Materials to another
party except as provided above, your licence is automatically
terminated. You may not vary, delete or obscure any notices of
proprietary rights or any product identification or restrictions
on or in the Materials.

4. No refund policy
You are expected to use the Materials on your system and to
thoroughly evaluate usefulness and functionality before making
a purchase. This "try before you buy" approach is the ultimate
guarantee that the Materials will perform to your satisfaction,
therefore, you understand and agree that the Licensor does not
operate a refund policy. 

5.Upgrades

5.1 You are entitled to free upgrades of the Materials for a
period of 12 months commencing on the date of purchase. The
free upgrades relate only to upgrades of the Materials. In the
event that you require upgrades for a period longer than 12
months you will need to purchase a new licence at the Licensor
then prevailing price. 

5.2 For the purposes of this clause 5 an upgrade shall cover
the provision of patches or fixes to correct errors in the
Materials and at the sole discretion of the Licensor such
upgrades may extend to the provision of new applications or
increased functionality to the Materials. For the avoidance
of doubt the Licensor reserves the right in its absolute
discretion to release enhancements to the functionality of the
Materials as new products and in such circumstances you will
need to purchase a new licence at the Licensor then prevailing
price. 

5.3 The Licensor reserves the right in its absolute discretion
to withdraw the Materials from sale and support at anytime on
giving 14 days notice and any such notice will be displayed on
the Licensor's website at www.breezesys.com.

5.4 Upgrades are available only by downloading them from the
Licensor's website at www.breezesys.com and are not made
available on CD-ROM.

6. No transfer
The Materials are licensed only to you. You may not rent, lease,
sub-lease, sell, assign, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose
of the Materials, on a temporary or permanent basis, without the
prior written consent of the Licensor.

7. Undertakings
You undertake to:

7.2 ensure that, prior to use of the Materials by your employees
or agents, all such parties are notified of this Agreement and
the terms of this Agreement;

party's notice as specified in the Materials) on all and any

Materials;

7.4 hold all drawings, specifications, data (including object
and source codes, and your registration code), software listings
and all other information relating to the Materials
confidential and not at any time, during this Agreement or after
its expiry, disclose the same, whether directly or indirectly,
to any third party without the Licensor's consent.

8. Limited warranty

8.1 Subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability
below, the Licensor warrants that the Materials will be free
from material defects under normal use.

8.2 The Licensor will also indemnify you for personal injury or
death solely and directly caused by any defect in its products
or the negligence of its employees.

8.3 The Licensor shall not be liable under the said warranty
above if the Materials fail to operate in accordance with the
said warranty as a result of any modification, variation or
addition to the Materials not performed by the Licensor or
caused by any abuse, corruption or incorrect use of the
Materials, including use of the Materials with equipment or
other software which is incompatible.

9. No other warranties
The foregoing warranty is made in lieu of any other warranties,
representations or guarantees of any kind, either expressed or
implied, including, but not limited to, any implied warranties
of quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose
or ability to achieve a particular result. You assume the
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Materials.
The Licensor does not warrant that the Materials will meet your
requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or
error free.

10. Exclusion of liability
Except in respect of personal injury or death caused directly
by the negligence of the Licensor, in no event will the Licensor
be liable to you for any damages arising from performance or
non-performance of the Materials for the duration of this
Agreement or for any damages caused by your failure to perform
your responsibilities. In addition, the Licensor will not be
liable for any lost profits, lost savings, loss of data or any
indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages arising
out of the use of or inability to use such Materials, even if
the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. Further the Licensor will not be liable for any damages
claimed by you based on any third party claim. In no event will
the Licensor's liability for any claim, whether in contract,
tort or any other theory of liability, exceed the licence fee
paid by you, if any. Nothing in this agreement limits liability
for fraudulent misrepresentation. 

11. Your statutory rights
This Agreement gives you specific legal rights and you may also
have other rights that vary from country to country. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties,
or certain kinds of limitations or exclusions of liability, so
the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you. Other
jurisdictions allow limitations and exclusions subject to
certain condition. In such a case the above limitations and
exclusions shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by the
laws of such applicable jurisdictions. If any part of the above
limitations or exclusions is held to be void or unenforceable,
such part shall be deemed to be deleted form this agreement and
the remainder of the limitation or exclusion shall continue in
full force and effect. Any rights that you may have as a
consumer (ie a purchaser for private as opposed to business,
academic or government use) are not affected.

rights or remedies under this Agreement will not be construed as
a waiver of that party's rights nor in any way affect the
validity of the whole or part of this Agreement nor prejudice
that party's right to take subsequent action.
